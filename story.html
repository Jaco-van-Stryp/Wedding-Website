        Elizabeth and I met on this game that we played. We were one of the very few people left in this world that cared about playing this game.
        <br>
        <br>
        Many did not even know this game existed. We shared a connection from a very young age since we started playing this game. As time progressed we learned that we stayed close to eachother.
        <br>
        <br>
        We started talking over the phone, calling eachother for hours on end, never getting to a stage where it was boring. We eventually decided to visit eachother, know more about eachother, Thats how it all started.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Elizabeth and I felt like we had this connection that was worth giving a try, so we did... That was the best disition of my life! 
        We fell in love. She was the person I never knew I always wanted. Every day I would take the time to make sure she is happy, and she did the same for me.
        We had many obsticals in the way, but non has come even close to destroying the connection we had. It was Perfect.
        I want to spend my the rest of my life with this woman, because I cant imagine a day without her.
        <br>
        <br>

        We always loved music and eating at fancy resturants, exploring the world to see what there is to provide our taste buds with satisfaction. Our wedding will be filled with the joys of music, and it will have some of the world's best food.
       <br>
       <br>
       Even though it doesnt sound all that exciting, it is what we always wanted. We wanted our guests as happy for us as we were to each other.
